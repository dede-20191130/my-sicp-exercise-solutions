## SICP EXERCISE SOLUTIONS ON MY OWN (ON-GOING)

Here are SICP Textbook's exercise solutions with test codes which I have worked on and made.  
The repository is on-going.

## SORRY FOR SOME MISSING EXERCISES

I apologize for the missing answers to some of the exercises. Before I started Exercise 2-73, I had used [https://replit.com/~](https://replit.com/) and BiwaScheme. Since it enabled me to solve the problems online, I did not leave codes of solution.

## ADDITIONALLY

[This article](https://dede-20191130.github.io/en/posts/2022/05/22/sicp-restyle/) is what makes SICP textbook site more useful and easy to understand.
